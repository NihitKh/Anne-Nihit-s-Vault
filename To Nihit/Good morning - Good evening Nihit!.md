We were just at the Sunday Council Meeting.  Missed you.  We told the group about us working together, but didn't go into what.  We did tell them how helpful you've been an integrating from Marvin to Notion (*make work fun*).  Conrad came right back after that.  He said he would have to get together with you because he is very interested in it.  HEADS UP!!

Otherwise pretty cool stuff.  It is now just after 10AM and guest will be here in about 4 hours.  They usually stay about four hours ... this is the family (Rich's oldest son and his husband), who are very enjoyable to talk to.  ESPECIALLY... when Jon goes to talk to his father and that leaves me and RJ.  We ALWAYS have stuff to talk to him about.  He is very colorful.

So, if we get a chance to bump up together ... we'll be taking tours around the house to assure everything is in place, but it's looking good from here.  Maybe throw in the blankets on the couch.  Sometimes RJ takes a short nap ... it's about a 2 hour - 1-way drive for him.  

Anyway HEY!  Happy to meet up with your day!

Always our love,
Us

Saw a term the other day ... Productivity Partner ... I think this is who we both are :) :)

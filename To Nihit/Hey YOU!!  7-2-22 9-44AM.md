Just seeing how you are doing ... we've been working on a new name and it isn't all the way magical, but serves many magical purposes.  This is our suggestion.

GANPET:  Gallery of Ann-Nihit Psych-Ed Tutorials: Observing, analyzing, and refining the way we learn through multi-media. Learning that applies from Medical students to Multiples, Adults to Children, AND PET includes from Baby Panda's to Collies!

Could we do it?  Have you had other ideas?


- [x] Think of something Nihit!


### Nihit's Thoughts
I think that the name should be easy enough to understand & pronounce. So my suggestion would be
- Learning With Anne & Nihit
- Anne & Nihit
- All Things Tutorials
	- But this restricts us to tutorials, so no.
- Lifelong Learners
	- I really like this one, there is one more channel with the same name, it's not that big, yeah so in my opinion, this is it.

- [ ] Go through Anne's categories if she needs them to be revised in Marvin
- [ ] Create a roadmap with upcoming, planning features, maybe in Notion
- [ ] Create a bunch of projects for this thing & assign them a review or a due date to get them out of my head
- [ ] We can have like 2 tags "anne" & "nihit", then these can have nested tags, which I can pull via a dataview code, these tags are supposed to be like the smart lists in custom alerts, i.e. they are supposed to be empty, if not, I would get a notification, we wiil figure out the notification thing down the road.

- [ ] Khan Academy
	- [ ] smaller goal, but similar - start from closet because Khan had nephews and nieces who needing to learn 
- [ ] learn all information - organize it and learn from it
- [ ] other branches (people by groups/categories)
- [ ] others of us other than doctors are trying to figure out "order" too - doctors may have the bigger part of the puzzle, BUT the same principles of learning apply

- [ ] same principles and tools ... we want to show how they work together hand in glove
- [ ] we both have information/tasks to be organized (medical to multiple, etc.) and trying to work out a system from our different content.  Similar goals.

- [ ] Dr. Marvin, "You will get there too.""

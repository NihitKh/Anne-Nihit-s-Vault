Change things that reduce stress levels

Less frustrated

More open to new things

Figure out which apps are being used (tech in general)

to make life comfortable

First
	how to - flight school
	how to - lyt workshop
	how to - shared lyt workshop

Passion about technology (how to use better and that it works better for people)

It makes an impact in our life (going over cost and reduce financial stress)

we can take care of financial stress and put them to better use

Most over 50 etc. don't have patience curiosity or time

Us on the otherhand have these things and light up like a panda in figuring it out

63 ... 

most older people (tech is new) Nihit's GM calls on what'sap ... does something silly ... frustrated, grumpy, over accounts, too many passwords ... using GF account

freak out with different directions

leave from home and sort it out

really good job online learning ... that's who we are for grumpy old people

but forgot where file was

come back.
